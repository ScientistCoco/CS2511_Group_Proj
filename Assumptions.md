# Assumptions that were made for this project:
- When the hunter dies and a hound exists on the map, the hound will still continue to exist on the map and will continue to hunt the player.
- The player does not need to go through the exit to complete the level, they can find the exit first and complete other objectives
- The player is allowed to stack buffs
